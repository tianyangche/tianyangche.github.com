author: Tianyang Che
author_bio: I'm the intersection of three identities: Builder, Investor, and Entrepreneur. With over a decade at Meta, Amazon, and Coupang, I build systems, products, and teams that solve meaningful problems. I invest in companies that create real value and have the potential to compound over decades. I'm driven to make the world slightly better through what I build—by creating things people find genuinely useful.
