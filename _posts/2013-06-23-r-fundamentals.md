I've learned data mining last semester, which is an extremely interesting course. The course consists of 5 homework, all of which are so hard that I had to spend at least one week on each of them... This course requires to use R language. I've been coding using it. It is my first time to write something about knowledge, thus I will try my best to work on this tutorial for those who is new to R.


## What is R?

According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), R is a free software programming and a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data miners.
