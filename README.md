## 🌍 About Me

In my professional life, I see myself as the intersection of three identities:

### 🧱 Builder  
With over a decade of experience at Meta, Amazon, and Coupang, I build systems, products, and teams that solve meaningful problems.  
I love turning ideas into things that work.

### 💹 Investor  
I invest in companies—both private and public—that create real value and have the potential to compound over decades.

### 🚀 Entrepreneur  
I’m driven to make the world slightly better through what I build—by creating things people find genuinely useful.

> These three identities form the same mission:  
> **To spend my life building, backing, and creating things that last.**

## 🧭 Recent Reflection (2025-10-28)

Today I interviewed a young engineer—ten years younger than me—who built a fully functional iOS app on his own.  
In him, I saw the version of myself I once wanted to become.  
It sparked both admiration and an awakening:  
the realization that the world has shifted, and that I want to reclaim the creative energy I once had.

For the past decade, I’ve focused on architecture, leadership, and systems—learning how to make things stable, scalable, and organized.  
But now, I feel an urge to **build again**.  
To make things that are mine.  
To live as a builder, not just an operator.

At the same time, I’ve made another quiet but firm decision:  
**I will no longer waste my energy on meaningless people or trivial politics.**  
Looking back, perhaps 50–60% of my time in the past 36 years was lost to that.  
From now on, I’ll spend my energy only on **creation, learning, and compounding value**.

## 🕰️ Time Reconciliation Letter

### ✉️ To my 25-year-old self  
Thank you for working so hard to survive, to learn, and to be seen.  
You didn’t choose wrong—you built the foundation I now stand on.  
The systems you studied, the patience you learned, the compromises you made—  
they are what allow me today to finally **build freely**.

### ✉️ To my 45-year-old self  
I’ve started.  
I’m building my own products, my own systems, my own company, my own world.  
This is not compensation; this is **returning** to who I was meant to be.  
Whatever happens, remember this moment:  
the day I stopped waiting for permission to create.

## 🪞 My Current Focus

- Building AI-driven, human-centered products (starting with the iOS waste-sorting app).  
- Learning modern full-stack tools: **Next.js / SwiftUI / Supabase / FastAPI / OpenAI API**.  
- Living with deliberate energy — avoiding noise, investing deeply in what compounds.
